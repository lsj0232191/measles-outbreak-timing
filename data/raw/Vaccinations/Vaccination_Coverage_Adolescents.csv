\1Starting in 2014, the National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS–Teen) implemented a new definition of adequate provider data. Data for 2013 shown in this table are revised based on the 2014 definition. In general, 2013 NIS–Teen vaccination coverage estimates using the revised adequate provider data definition are different, and generally lower, than original 2013 NIS–Teen estimates. As a result, data for 2013 and beyond are not directly comparable with data for earlier years. For more information on the revised criteria and its effect on coverage levels, see Sources and Definitions, National Immunization Surveys (NIS). 
\2Denominator comprises adolescents aged 13–17 with no history of varicella disease. History of varicella disease is obtained by parent or guardian report or provider records. Historically, report of varicella disease has been considered valid evidence of immunity under the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines. For more information, see: Marin M, Bialek SR, Seward JF. Updated recommendations for use of VariZIG—United States, 2013. MMWR Recomm Rep 62(28):574–6. 2013. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6228a4.htm.
\3Tdap is tetanus toxoid-diphtheria vaccine (Td) or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or tetanus-unknown type vaccine received at or after age 10 years. For initial recommendations on Tdap vaccination, see: Broder KR, Cortese MM, Iskander JK, Kretsinger K, Slade BA, Brown KH, et al. Preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis among adolescents: Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccines.

\4Includes people receiving MenACWY or meningococcal vaccine of unknown type. For initial recommendations on meningococcal vaccination, see: Bilukha OO, Rosenstein N. Prevention and control of meningococcal disease: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep 54(RR07):1–21. 2005. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm.
\5In December 2016, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices released new recommendations on HPV vaccination stating that fully vaccinated against HPV (also called up-to-date) includes those with 3 doses or more, and those with 2 doses when the first HPV vaccine dose was received under age 15 years and having at least 5 months minus 4 days between the first and second dose. For more information, see: Meites E, Kempe A, Markowitz LE. Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination—Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 65(49):1405–8. 2016. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6549a5.htm.
\6For 2008, refers to HPV vaccine quadrivalent; for 2009–2014, refers to HPV vaccine quadrivalent or bivalent; and for 2015 and beyond, refers to HPV vaccine 9-valent, quadrivalent, or bivalent when specific vaccines are licensed and recommended for use among adolescents. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine was licensed by the FDA in June 2006. For initial recommendations on HPV vaccination, see: Markowitz LE, Dunne EF, Saraiya M, Lawson HW, Chesson H, Unger ER, et al. Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep 56(RR02):1–24. 2007. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5602a1.htm?s_cid=rr5602a1_e. HPV vaccine was recommended for males in October 2011. For more information, see: Dunne EF, Markowitz LE, Chesson H, Curtis CR, Saraiya M, Gee J, Unger ER. Recommendations on the use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in males—Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2011. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 60(50):1705–8. 2011. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6050a3.htm.
\7People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Estimates are tabulated using the 1997 “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.” Data for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander people and people of multiple races are not included because of small sample sizes. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin; Race.
\8Based on family income and family size using U.S. Census Bureau poverty thresholds. See Sources and Definitions, Family income; Poverty.
\9MSA is metropolitan statistical area. MSAs are defined based on the U.S. Office of Management and Budget delineation files. See Sources and Definitions, Metropolitan statistical area (MSA).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES: Vaccination coverage estimates are based on provider-verified responses from parents who live in households with telephones. Starting in 2011, the National Immunization Surveys (NIS) sampling frame was expanded from a single (landline) sampling frame to dual (landline and cell phone) sampling frames. Starting in 2018, NIS shifted to a single (cell phone) sampling frame design. Interpretation of vaccination data must take into account when specific vaccines are licensed and recommended for use among adolescents. Additional information on the recommended schedule for adolescent vaccination is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html.
