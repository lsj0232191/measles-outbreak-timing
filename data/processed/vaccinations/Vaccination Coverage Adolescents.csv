\1Starting in 2014, the National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS–Teen) implemented a new definition of adequate provider data. Data for 2013 shown in this table are revised based on the 2014 definition. In general, 2013 NIS–Teen vaccination coverage estimates using the revised adequate provider data definition are different, and generally lower, than original 2013 NIS–Teen estimates. As a result, data for 2013 and beyond are not directly comparable with data for earlier years. For more information on the revised criteria and its effect on coverage levels, see Sources and Definitions, National Immunization Surveys (NIS). 
\2Denominator comprises adolescents aged 13–17 with no history of varicella disease. History of varicella disease is obtained by parent or guardian report or provider records. Historically, report of varicella disease has been considered valid evidence of immunity under the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines.

\1Starting in 2014, the National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS–Teen) implemented a new definition of adequate provider data. Data for 2013 shown in this table are revised based on the 2014 definition. In general, 2013 NIS–Teen vaccination coverage estimates using the revised adequate provider data definition are different, and generally lower, than original 2013 NIS–Teen estimates. As a result, data for 2013 and beyond are not directly comparable with data for earlier years. For more information on the revised criteria and its effect on coverage levels, see Sources and Definitions, National Immunization Surveys (NIS).
