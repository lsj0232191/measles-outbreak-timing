Data for birth year are based on the 3 subsequent survey years. For example, 2010 birth year data are based on 2011, 2012, and 2013 survey data. Starting in 2018, National Immunization Surveys shifted from a dual (landline and cell phone) sampling frame to a single (cell phone) sampling frame design. See Sources and Definitions, National Immunization Surveys (NIS); Vaccination. Additional information on childhood immunizations is available from: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html.
